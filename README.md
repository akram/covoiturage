## Running ##

Weegotoschool can easily be run on OpenShift (the Open Source Platform as a Service (PaaS)) provided by Red Hat.

Start first with creating an account on OpenShift, it is free and require nothing less than a valid email address:
- [Create an OpenShift account by clicking me](https://www.openshift.com/app/account/new)

Once this step achieved, you can then just clic the following link:
- [Instantiate WeeGoToSchool Cartridge on OpenShift by clicking me](https://openshift.redhat.com/app/console/application_types/custom?name=weegotoschool&initial_git_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com/akram/weegotoschool.git&cartridges[]=php-5.4&cartridges[]=mongodb)

## Contributing ##
To contribute weegotoschool start by forking this repo and the submit Pull Requests to get your changes accepted.

Developing on OpenShift also creates an embedded git repository in OpenShift.
To simplyify developing, I hardly encourage you to enables dual push to simultaneously push all your commits on OpenShift and on your GitHub account.
